# X-Team 53 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Figure out the team member strength and preferences, then assign tasks accordingly. If workload turns to be unbalanced,  reassign tasks.  


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Establish milestones or checkpoints that need to be completed in a solid timeline. Each person is responsible for creating sub tasks and individual action steps for their portion of the project. 
We will check the repository regularly to make sure work is getting done.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will use Slack to communicate and post any difficulties in the #general tab where
each member can imput their thoughts on a solution or any schedule conflicts that conflicts with the assigned meeting time.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will have an internal due date 3 days before the actual due date. If a team member's assigned subsection is not complete by then, another team member will help complete the subsection. In return the team member that did not complete their assigned work on time will contribute more in the next part of the project cycle.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Bring all concerns you may have to the table so that we may work them out as a team rather than keeping those concerns to yourself and creating a bad experience.
Team members should provide clear and constant feedback. 
The team usually meets on a week to week basis every Monday at 7pm. Team meetings can occur more than once a week if needed.
